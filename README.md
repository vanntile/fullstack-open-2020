# Full stack open 2020

Full stack open 2020 is an online, open-source course aiming at teaching the
following concepts:

- React
- Redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- GraphQL
- TypeScript

This are my solutions for the [proposed exercises](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

Each separate project is in its own folder, marked either by assignment task (i.e. `unicafe-redux`) or part id (i.e. `part4`).
